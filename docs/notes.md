Creating a Non-Root User: Creating a non-root user inside the container helps to improve security by avoiding running processes as the root user. This can limit the potential damage in case of a security breach.

Consistency: Using ARG for these values allows you to parameterize the Dockerfile, making it easier to build images with different users or permissions as needed. You can override these defaults during the build process if necessary.

Customization: By defining these as arguments, you provide flexibility. For example, if you want to build the image in different environments where different user IDs are required, you can pass different values for UID and GID when building the Docker image.

Security: Running containers as a non-root user enhances security by limiting the potential damage that a compromised application can do. This is a good practice for reducing risks.

Permissions: The UID and GID are important for managing file permissions. If files created or modified by the container need to be accessed by the host or other containers, consistent UIDs and GIDs help avoid permission issues.

Container Environment: Within a container, the application user is not a system user but rather a user that the containerized application runs as. This user doesn't perform system administration tasks but operates with limited privileges within the container.
